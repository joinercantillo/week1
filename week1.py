# THE PROGRAM TAKES THE DATA THAT THE USER PROVIDES ABOUT THE NAME, QUANTITY, AND PRICE OF A PRODUCT; ALLOWING THE USER TO CORRECT THE INFORMATION ENTERED, USING THE LOOP WHILE THE VALIDATION VARIABLE IS 0, THE USER CORRECTS THE INFORMATION OF THEIR PRODUCT, BUT IF THE VALIDATION VARIABLE IS 1, IT THEN DISPLAYS THE TOTAL VALUE FOR EACH PURCHASE MADE.
